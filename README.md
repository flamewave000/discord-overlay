> **With the latest changes to Discord, they have fixed the issue my program was meant to solve. Which is to allow you to see a discord overlay over any program. Specifically when playing web games such as on Roll20 or FoundryVTT.**

# Discord Overlay

This overlay host is to provide a desktop overlay for when you're playing games in the browser and still want to see who's talking (such as TTRPGs on FoundryVTT or Roll20).

***Requires Windows and .NET v4.5.2 or greater***

## How to Use

### To start the overlay program
|Steps|Images|
|-|-|
|Extract and run the "Discord Overlay.exe" file. [Found in Releases](https://github.com/flamewave000/discord-overlay/releases)|![](.assets/download.png)![](.assets/run.png)|
|Move the "Discord Overlay Host" window somewhere out of the way (but must stay on screen somewhere, even in the background).|![](.assets/organize.png)|
|Place and resize the "Discord Overlay" window anywhere you want.|![](.assets/organize2.png)|

### To link the overlay with Discord
|Steps|Images|
|-|-|
|Make sure Discord Overlay Host is currently running (see above instructions for downloading and running it).||
|Open Discord's program settings|![](.assets/open-settings.png)|
|Go to the "Overlay" settings and make sure "Enable In-game overlay" is turned on.|![](.assets/enable-overlay.png)|
|Go to the "Game Activity" settings, and click the "Add it!" blue text.|![](.assets/add-game.png)|
|Select "Discord Overlay Host" from the dropdown menu|![](.assets/select-overlay.png)|
|Click "Add Game"|![](.assets/accept.png)|
|You should now see this big green banner, but make sure click the monitor icon on the right to Toggle ON the overlay for the program.|![](.assets/toggle-game-overlay.png)|
|Once that is turned on, click the settings close button. After a few moments (be patient) the Discord Overlay program should appear in the Discord Overlay Host and Discord Overlay windows simultaneously.|![](.assets/overlay-is-on.png)|
|JOIN A VOICE CHAT!||
|When EITHER window is FOCUSED, you will be able to see the "Discord Overlay" window and resize it as would any normal window.|![](.assets/overlay-window-visible.png)|
|But once you UNFOCUS the windows (ie. click on your browser window), the "Discord Overlay" window frame will vanish, and only Discord's overlay content will remain.|![](.assets/overlay-window-gone.png)|

The Discord Overlay Host window must always be open and NOT minimized, but you can let it get buried by other windows.

**IMPORTANT!** If you need to interact directly with Discord's overlay (such as if Discord is asking you to do something), you may do so using the "Discord Overlay Host" window, *not* the one that vanishes.
